# Guard the "always test the latest published packages" policy:
#   1. no committed PACKAGE lock files (go.sum, bun.lock, Cargo.lock, ...), so
#      every run re-resolves the moq packages to their latest. flake.lock is
#      fine: it pins the dev toolchain, not the moq packages, and the moq "nix"
#      channel references the moq flake ad-hoc so the moq version is never locked;
#   2. the moq packages under test are requested as "latest", never pinned;
#   3. the one unavoidable pin (npm `playwright`, which must match the toolchain's
#      Chromium build) equals what the toolchain ships, so a toolchain bump can't
#      quietly leave it stale.
#
# Run standalone (`just freshness`) or as the opening step of smoke.sh.
