  # every `nix develop` resolves the latest toolchain (and the latest Chromium),
  # matching the "always test latest" policy. The one version that has to line up
  # (npm `playwright` <-> this Chromium) is exported below as PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION
  # and enforced by smoke.sh, so a nixpkgs bump can't silently drift.
