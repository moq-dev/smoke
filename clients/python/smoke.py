"""Cross-language interop client for the smoke test (PyPI `moq-rs`, import `moq`).

publish:   read raw Annex-B H.264 from stdin (e.g. piped from ffmpeg) and feed
           it to a streaming importer, which infers frame boundaries.
subscribe: connect, find the video track in the catalog, and exit 0 as soon as
           any non-empty frame arrives (exit 1 on timeout / no data).
